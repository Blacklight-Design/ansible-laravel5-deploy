# Laravel5 Deploy

Brought to you by [Blacklight](http://www.blacklight.co.za).

Deployment role for Laravel 5 apps. Deployment can be done via Git, SVN, Mercurial, and Rsync. Tries to imitate a similar
structure to what you would see with other deployment tools such as [Capistrano](http://capistranorb.com/). The final
directory structure will look something like this:

```
project
    releases
        // All releases will be going here
    shared
        storage
            logs
            framework
                sessions
        public
            uploads
    current // This will be a symlink to the latest release
```

The role also has error checking in place. If any of the steps fail the role will delete the newly created release folder
and stop execution. If the deploy was successful the role will remove old releases.
